# Reinforcement Learning for Stock Price Prediction and Portfolio Optimization

A cutting-edge system that integrates sentiment analysis from financial news and reports with reinforcement learning to predict stock movements and optimize portfolio value through intelligent buy/sell/hold strategies.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment-Aware Trading**: Combines sentiment from news articles and company reports using FinBERT.
- **Custom Daily Sentiment Score**: Aggregates sentiment from multiple sources to represent market perception.
- **Multi-Modal Feature Set**: Integrates numerical indicators (e.g., revenue, EPS) with sentiment signals.
- **RL-Based Strategy**: Employs a Deep Q-Network (DQN) or PPO agent to learn optimal actions in a dynamic market.
- **Backtesting Module**: Evaluates performance on historical data with custom reward functions.
- **Buy/Sell/Hold Decision System**: Action space designed for practical portfolio management.
